# Alumni Network

Keep in touch, build connections, and be part of the NNT Alumni Network during this exciting time in the history of the Nottingham New Theatre.

We produce bi-annual newsletters, alongside our Facebook and Twitter accounts. Our network has expanded over the last few years to include over 200 members, with our earliest members graduating back in 1953!

The Alumni Network was founded several years ago in order to build a stronger sense of the history of the theatre, to build connections between current and previous members and to keep alumni informed of the progress of the theatre and of fellow alumni.

If you haven't already, please register here.

## History Project

The Alumni Network's History Project was started with the aim of archiving every show, committee, member and publicity material since the start of student theatre at the University of Nottingham. We are pleased to announce we are now live and online at [history.newtheatre.org.uk](http://history.newtheatre.org.uk)

This is an extremely exciting project for the Nottingham New Theatre, and something which is completely unique among both student and professional theatres in this country. We haven't found a single other theatre which offers such an extensive, vibrant and interactive online archive.

Our current information suggests that the Nottingham Dramatic Society formed in 1927 – this means that we have a history which spans almost 90 years! I hope you enjoy browsing the archives and if you can help with any missing shows, posters, flyers or anything else, just press the Report button on any page on the website or email us at <alumni@newtheatre.org.uk>.

## Alumni Dinner — Saturday 19 March 2016

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Nottingham New Theatre, all NNT Alumni are invited to the inaugural annual dinner of The Nottingham New Theatre Alumni Network. This will be a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the theatre's vibrant history as well as a unique chance to catch up with old friends and take a trip down memory lane.

The evening celebrations will comprise a drinks reception in the Great Hall and a chance to browse the NNT Archives, followed by a three course, drinks and entertainment. There will also be an opportunity during the afternoon for a tour around the newly redeveloped theatre building led by current students.

For further details and to register for the event, visit the Alumni Office page. Formal invitations will be sent to all registered NNT Alumni in December. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
