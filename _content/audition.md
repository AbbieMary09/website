    synopsis: |
        Emotionally Unavailable' Brian(na) is miserable after their ex dumps them, saying they donâ€™t know how to feel. Although Brian(na) is not really sure what to do with that information, their emotions are livid and demand to be heard! They force Brian(na) into discussion and exploration of how they themselves feel and function, trying to find a way to make it through this tough time. 

        A student spin inspired by Pixar's Inside Out, 'Self-ish' brings an alternative way to view the complex happenings of the mind through light-hearted comedy and the beloved Zoom format.
