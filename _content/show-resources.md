## Pre-Proposals 

## Post-Proposals 

# Proposals Forms 

You'll need to fill in either of these forms and submit it to the relevant Season Co-ordinator by email before the deadline for your proposal to be considered.

### Tips and Rules 
- The Proposal Form must be used exactly (no modification to questions)
- Word limits must be adhered to
- Draft it in Word or Google Docs and then paste it into the form - very useful if you're working as a team
- More detailed advice can be found in the [Pre-Proposals pack](#pre-proposals)
