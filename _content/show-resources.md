# Productions Packs

Thinking of putting on a show? Already doing a show and looking for some help? You’re in the right place. We’ve got a wealth of resources about our forms, venues and just about everything else involved in putting on a show at the Nottingham New Theatre.

## Pre-Proposals 

### Proposals Pack

If you’re looking to propose, check out our Proposals Pack. It’s a handy guide to filling in the proposals form for both the In House and Fringe seasons.

### External Venues Pack

If you’re proposing for the Fringe season, you may be interested in our External Venues Pack, which has information about off-site venues that we’ve worked in before. Don’t feel you’re limited to these though – just about anywhere can be a performance venue!

### Sample Questions

During the Q&A part of the Proposals Day, the committee will be posing questions to you. We’ve prepared a list of some of the most common – but by no means the only ones you may face!

### Welfare Pack

The Content Warnings and Welfare Considerations section of the Proposals Form needs to be quite involved, so we have a separate pack of resources and things you may wish to consider.

## Post-Proposals 

So, you’ve got your show – congratulations! The work’s only just begun, and we know that putting on a show can be a daunting experience for even the most seasoned of production teams. To help, we’ve put together a Show Pack, which contains information about publicity, front of house, tech, and lots of other things we think will be useful. It’s new for 2018, and has information relevant for both brand new teams and people who’ve done a show before, so do take a look.

### Publicity Pack

For everything you need to publicise your show, complete with deadlines and guides for production shots, rehearsal videos, and social media tips.

### Backstage Pack 

This pack will contain all the information you need for the backstage areas of the theatre. This is most useful for set designers/builders and the tech team, but is also useful for production teams as it has diagrams and measurements of the spaces in all of the most common seating configurations.

### Code of Conduct 

This document must be read and signed by all production team members as the very first thing you do for your show. It’s here in case you need a reminder.


# Proposals Forms 

You'll need to fill in either of these forms and submit it to the relevant Season Co-ordinator by email before the deadline for your proposal to be considered.

### Tips and Rules 
- The Proposal Form must be used exactly (no modification to questions)
- Word limits must be adhered to
- Draft it in Word or Google Docs and then paste it into the form - very useful if you're working as a team
- More detailed advice can be found in the [Pre-Proposals pack](#pre-proposals)
