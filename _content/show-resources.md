# Proposals Forms 

You'll need to fill in either of these forms and submit it to the relevant Season Co-ordinator by email before the deadline for your proposal to be considered.

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

**Season Coordinators**
{% include committee.html group="coordinator" format="list" %}

### Tips and Rules 
- The Proposal Form must be used exactly (no modification to questions)
- Word limits must be adhered to
- Draft it in Word or Google Docs and then paste it into the form - very useful if you're working as a team
- More detailed advice can be found in the [Pre-Proposals pack](#pre-proposals)

{% include file-download.html file="preproposal/Spring-Fringe-Proposals-Form.docx" name="Fringe Proposals Form" type="word" color="nnt-orange"  %}

External and Edinburgh forms are available on request by emailing {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}.

# Production Resources

Thinking of putting on a show? Already doing a show and looking for some help? You’re in the right place. We’ve got a wealth of resources about our forms, venues and just about everything else involved in putting on a show at the Nottingham New Theatre.

## Pre-Proposals 

### Proposals Pack

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

If you’re looking to propose, check out our Proposals Pack. It’s a handy guide to filling in the proposals form for both the In House and Fringe seasons.

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="preproposal/Proposals-Pack-2018-19.pdf" name="Proposals Pack" type="pdf" color="nnt-purple" %}
</div></div>

### External Venues Pack

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

If you’re proposing for the Fringe season, you may be interested in our External Venues Pack, which has information about off-site venues that we’ve worked in before. Don’t feel you’re limited to these though – just about anywhere can be a performance venue!

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="preproposal/External-Venues-Pack-2018-19.pdf" name="External Venues Pack" type="pdf" color="nnt-orange"  %}

</div></div>

### Sample Questions

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

During the Q&A part of the Proposals Day, the committee will be posing questions to you. We’ve prepared a list of some of the most common – but by no means the only ones you may face!

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="preproposal/Sample-Questions.pdf" name="Sample Questions" type="pdf" color="nnt-purple"  %}

</div></div>

### Welfare Pack

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

The Content Warnings and Welfare Considerations section of the Proposals Form needs to be quite involved, so we have a separate pack of resources and things you may wish to consider.

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="preproposal/Welfare-Pack.pdf" name="Welfare Pack" type="pdf" color="nnt-orange"  %}

</div></div>

## Post-Proposals 

So, you’ve got your show – congratulations! The work’s only just begun, and we know that putting on a show can be a daunting experience for even the most seasoned of production teams. To help, we’ve put together a Show Pack, which contains information about publicity, front of house, tech, and lots of other things we think will be useful. It’s new for 2018, and has information relevant for both brand new teams and people who’ve done a show before, so do take a look.

### Code of Conduct 

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

This document must be read and signed by all production team members as the very first thing you do for your show. It’s here in case you need a reminder.

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="postproposal/Code-of-Conduct.pdf" name="Code of Conduct" type="pdf" color="nnt-purple"  %}

</div></div>

### Publicity Pack

<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8" markdown="1">

For everything you need to publicise your show, complete with deadlines and guides for production shots, rehearsal videos, and social media tips.

</div><div class="col-lg-4 text-lg-right" markdown="1">

{% include file-download.html file="postproposal/Publicity-Pack-2018_19.pdf" name="Publicity Pack" type="pdf" color="nnt-orange"  %}

</div></div>

<!-- 
### Backstage Pack 

This pack will contain all the information you need for the backstage areas of the theatre. This is most useful for set designers/builders and the tech team, but is also useful for production teams as it has diagrams and measurements of the spaces in all of the most common seating configurations.
