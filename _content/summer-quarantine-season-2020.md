# Summer Quarantine Season

This summer the Nottingham New Theatre will be creating six pieces of digital theatre for the membership and a wider audience. This is an opportunity for actors, writers and directors to get involved in creating theatre from their own home. To find out more check out the Proposals Pack. To propose fill out the Proposals form and email it to any one of our three season coordinators before the deadline.
