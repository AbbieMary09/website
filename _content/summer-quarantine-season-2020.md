# Summer Quarantine Season

In light of the artistically cripping pandemic the Nottingham New Theatre has taken the decision to trial a ‘Quarantine Season’ of shows over the summer months. This is the online creation of virtual theatre which will be posted on the NNT YouTube channel and shared across our platforms for all to watch. We do this with the awareness that our typical way of running a season may not be viable if social distancing measures are still in place in autumn. The season is an opportunity to refine what we want from an online season and how we can best achieve this should it be necessary to repeat the process. As such, we stress the flexibility of the process which will enable us to know in greater detail what our limitations are and just how far we can push our ambitions.

This process has the potential to be incredibly rewarding, not only for the actors involved, but also for the aspiring writer, the imaginative video designers and editors, and the inquisitive member who wants to learn new skills without having the same kind of intense pressure found in a normal production process.

This will be a learning curve but we are very excited to get NNT up and running remotely. If you have any questions please contact one of the <a href="quarantine@newtheatre.org.uk" class="alert-link">coordinators</a>
