# Get Involved

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to rig lights in a theatre? Ever toyed with the idea of directing a play? Pondered what it might be like to get up on stage in front of hundreds of people? Longed to design and build an entire set?

The New Theatre is one of the biggest student-run groups at Nottingham, and the only student-run theatre in England, and if any of the above is true for you, then the New Theatre is definitely where it's at.

The best times to get involved with all aspects of the theatre are at the start of each season (October and January), when we hold our AGMs. Come along to hear about what plays are being put on and find out how you can get involved; we always need new actors, technicians, builders, designers, costume and make-up artists, stage hands; the list goes on. If you can't make an AGM, don't worry & sling an email to <secretary@newtheatre.org.uk> and we'll hook you up with the good stuff ASAP!
