# Acting

The New Theatre welcomes all actors. There is a policy of an actor only being in one play a semester, meaning that more people have the opportunity to tread the New Theatre boards. So if you've never been on a stage before, or were the sheep in your Nativity Play, or have acted at school, or have been in Casualty, or have performed at the RSC, or simply just dabble, please come along and audition!

## Auditions

Auditions for each season's plays are held over a three day period at the beginning of each semester. Anyone, providing they're a member of New Theatre, can audition. Auditions are always fair and open. Auditions will typically comprise of being given a speech or a scene, told to go and look at it for ten minutes and then asked to do it for the director. Directors are free to hold auditions any way they like, so there isn't really anything you can do to prepare.

It is a good idea to sign-up and audition for everything. This means you will get more experience of auditions and stand a greater chance of being cast in a play.
