# Costume, Props & Make-up

Every show needs costumes, props and/or make-up in some form, and by getting involved in this brilliantly creative aspect of a theatre production, you will become a vital member of the backstage crew. You will work with the director, producer, stage manager and cast to help to make the show look as good as it can on stage.

If you have a talent for costume design, prop construction or make-up, the theatre would like to hear from you! No experience is necessary- enthusiasm is the only initial requirement! We intend to have costume and make up workshops throughout the year, so there will be plenty of opportunity to learn and improve the skills you have already and/or pick up from working on shows.

If you think that costume, props and make up is something you might be interested in, or you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in contact. You might be assigned to a show or, if you would rather maintain a broader experience, you can help out as and when shows require assistance. Hope to see you soon!
