# Publicise

The role of Publicity Rep within the Nottingham New Theatre is to help spread awareness both on and off Campus about your assigned show. This involves organising posters, flyering and coming up with unique and novel ideas to promote your show. The best way to get involved with this role is at the beginning of the season during the AGM, where sign ups will be available for all those who are interested.

## What does being a Publicity Rep entail?

You'll be in contact with the Producer and Director of the show from day one, discussing the best ways to publicise your show, coming up with new and exciting ways to raise awareness for your show, organise the posters and flyering that go out on show week and also think of ideas for successful fundraisers.

If it's not your week for a show, you'll be helping out with publicising other shows, even if it's just flyering for an hour or two.

If you're ever stuck or need advice, the two Publicity Managers will be on hand to help you out.
