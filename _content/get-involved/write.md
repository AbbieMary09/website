# Writing

It's easy to lose sight of the fact that without someone having come up with an idea for a script, and then ultimately writing it, we here at the Nottingham New Theatre would, simply put, have nothing to put on. New writing has been a huge part of this theatre's success and progress in recent years, and it is becoming an increasingly invaluable part of our creative future. Not only has it differentiated us from other student theatres across the country, it has also ultimately produced our Edinburgh shows for many years now, and will continue to do so this summer.

No one within the theatre has the specific responsibility to ensure new writing is constantly being produced because there is no need for one; we are incredibly fortunate to have a highly creative, imaginative membership which year-in, year-out produces writing of an exceptional standard.

Our membership is blessed with an opportunity that rarely presents itself in the professional world; the opportunity to come up with an idea, write a script and then ultimately see it performed in front of sizeable audiences up on the Nottingham New Theatre stage.

In recent history, shows such as Innocent Infidelity and Too Far Away have graced the Nottingham New Theatre stage, whilst the likes of Accidental Loss of a Baby, Voice without Words and Paradise have represented New Writing in the UNCUT season to a superb reception. The fact we make a point of only accepting original, new writing for our Edinburgh shows every summer, ensure there are always opportunities to introduce new and interesting ideas. Thanks to a wide variety of workshops and new writing evenings, this aspect of the Nottingham New Theatre is growing exponentially, and will continue to do so in the coming years. We are always extremely eager to consider something new and exciting from any budding playwrights, and there are a number of ways to get involved.

## How to get involved

The first step to getting involved in new writing at the Nottingham New Theatre is simply having an idea and going for it! After that, make sure you get yourself along to the series of new writing evenings and workshops that will be on offer in the coming year.

If you're interested in getting a slot for your play, here are a few top tips to follow:

- Ensure your first draft is finished well in advance before you propose, to allow time for necessary edits and also to circulate amongst members of the theatre for advice.

- Make sure to think about how you might stage your play as you write it or, if you don't plan to direct yourself, have someone in mind to offer their take on the potential staging of the show, including set, lighting, costumes etc.

- Probably the most important point: get your play out there! Get as many people as possible to read it and offer their advice. You'll be making life easier for yourself and the committee charged with choosing the plays for the season if people are talking about it and know the ideas and logistics behind it.
