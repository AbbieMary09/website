# Sound Design

For a typical season sound design comprises both compiling sound effects and the composition of original scores. Shows will vary in their requirements, but there will always be plenty of opportunity to get involved.

Our sound design is all developed in house, and encompasses both composition and digital mixing. Our speaker set-up offers an impressive and non-restrictive soundstage and in a typical season there will be many opportunities for sound designers to tackle a multitude of exciting and varied designs.
