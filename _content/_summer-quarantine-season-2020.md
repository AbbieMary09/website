### The Nottingham New Theatre has taken the decision to trial a 'Quarantine Season' of shows over the summer. 

This is the online creation of virtual theatre which will be posted on the NNT YouTube channel and shared across our platforms for all to watch. We do this with the awareness that our typical way of running a season may not be viable if social distancing measures are still in place in Autumn. 

This process has the potential to be incredibly rewarding, not only for the actors involved, but also for aspiring writers, the imaginative video designers and editors, and the inquisitive members who want to learn new skills.

This will be a learning curve but we are very excited to get NNT up and running remotely. If you have any questions please contact <quarantine@newtheatre.org.uk>.

#### The shows will be announced here and on our social media in the coming weeks, so keep your eye out for those.
