# Deadline for Proposals: {% include date.html date="ef-proposals-deadline" %}

We take two shows up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival who take turns to perform in our allocated slot each evening (5:20pm - 6:20pm). We are performing in [Thespace venue: Perth Theatre.](https://www.thespaceuk.com/venue-specifications/thespace-on-north-bridge-perth/ "TheSpace venue: Perth Theatre")

> The festival is currently planning to go ahead as usual and thus this is our approach too.

## Proposals

With the ever changing nature of government restrictions and COVID-19 itself, we cannot guarantee that things will go ahead as planned. **By proposing you are accepting this risk.** We guarantee that you will not be negatively impacted in any financial capacity. It is unclear which restrictions we may need to follow during a real life performance. **Currently the most likely option is an outside performance.** The venue director will advise us on the safest way to perform and we will need to make the necessary adjustments. We ask for **flexibility and adaptability** in all proposing teams. We want the chosen shows to have the best chance at going ahead regardless of changing restrictions.

If you have any questions please get in touch with {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}

## Acting

### Auditions

Auditions will be carried out using self-tapes. You can do a maximum of two self-tapes for each show, any more than this will not be considered by the production team. You can audition for both shows. 

Audition extracts, character descriptions and content warnings for each show will be released on Thursday morning via the [NNT members page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2747053805538161 "NNT members page"). **Please read all content warnings for each show before any extracts.** If you are uncomfortable with any aspect of the show you do not need to audition. If you have any questions about content warnings please contact the production team, {% include committee.html role="welfare" format="inline" %} or {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}. 

The deadline for self-tapes is **Friday 7th at 4pm**, any tapes sent after this will not be considered. Please be considerate towards our production teams and do not wait until the last minute to send your videos. The videos you send will not be used for any other purpose than that of casting and will not be distributed further than each production team. In your video please clearly state your name and the part you are auditioning for.

In your email you must include:

* Your availability for callbacks on {% include date.html date="ef-auditions-callbacks" %}
* Your phone number and your availability to be called on Sunday 9th. If you do not give us your phone number we will not be able to cast you as we conduct casting by calling actors throughout the day (09/05). We recommend that you use a site called WeTransfer to condense your video file if it is too large to send across email.

If you are experiencing any difficulties do not hesitate to contact {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}.
