# Deadline for Proposals: {% include date.html date="ef-proposals-deadline" %}

We take two shows up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival who take turns to perform in our allocated slot each evening (5:20pm - 6:20pm). We are performing in [Thespace venue: Perth Theatre.](https://www.thespaceuk.com/venue-specifications/thespace-on-north-bridge-perth/ "TheSpace venue: Perth Theatre")

> The festival is currently planning to go ahead as usual and thus this is our approach too.

## Proposals

With the ever changing nature of government restrictions and COVID-19 itself, we cannot guarantee that things will go ahead as planned. **By proposing you are accepting this risk.** We guarantee that you will not be negatively impacted in any financial capacity. It is unclear which restrictions we may need to follow during a real life performance. **Currently the most likely option is an outside performance.** The venue director will advise us on the safest way to perform and we will need to make the necessary adjustments. We ask for **flexibility and adaptability** in all proposing teams. We want the chosen shows to have the best chance at going ahead regardless of changing restrictions.

If you have any questions please get in touch with {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}

## Acting

### Auditions

Auditions will be carried out using self-tapes. You can do a maximum of two self-tapes for each show, any more than this will not be considered by the production team. You can audition for both shows.

Audition extracts, character descriptions and content warnings for each show will be released on Thursday morning via the [NNT members page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2747053805538161 "NNT members page"). **Please read all content warnings for each show before any extracts.** If you are uncomfortable with any aspect of the show you do not need to audition. If you have any questions about content warnings please contact the production team, {% include committee.html role="secretary" format="inline" %} or {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}.

The deadline for self-tapes is **Friday 7th May at 4pm**, any tapes sent after this will not be considered. Please be considerate towards our production teams and do not wait until the last minute to send your videos. The videos you send will not be used for any other purpose than that of casting and will not be distributed further than each production team. In your video please clearly state your name and the part you are auditioning for. We recommend that you use a site called WeTransfer to condense your video file if it is too large to send across email.

In your email you must include:

* Your availability for callbacks on {% include date.html date="ef-auditions-callbacks" %}
* Your phone number and your availability to be called on {% include date.html date="ef-casting" %}. If you do not give us your phone number we will not be able to cast you as we conduct casting by calling actors throughout the day.

If you are experiencing any difficulties do not hesitate to contact {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}.

### Callbacks

On Friday (07/05) night a callbacks list will be released onto the members page. Please consult this and note down when you have been called back and for which show. You may be called back twice for the same show but you should not be called back for different shows at the same time. If you have been double booked please get in contact with {% include committee.html role="secretary" format="inline" %} or {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %} as this would be a mistake. Callbacks will be conducted in 30 minute slots via zoom (video calling service). Please download this software prior to Saturday and ensure punctuality. You may still be cast even if you are not called back so please stay by your phone on the Sunday regardless.

### Casting

On {% include date.html date="ef-casting" %} a casting meeting will take place. We cast parts by working through shows one at a time. We will flip a coin to determine which parts we start with (M, F, GN) and work through them one at a time. This is a lengthy process so **please stay by your phone all day.** If a team wants to cast you, you will receive a phone call. If you do not answer we will keep trying to contact you, but after 15 minutes will need to move on. You may be offered multiple parts so please take time after auditions / callbacks to consider which shows you would prefer to be in.

## Production Team

For each show going to Edinburgh, there are three compulsory roles: **Publicity Manager**, **Technical Stage Manager**, and **Show Assistant**. These individuals will travel up to Edinburgh with the cast, director and producer. The specifics of the show assistant role will be confirmed once the shows have been selected. This may take the form of an assistant director, production assistant or a combination.

The team can also include a **Lighting Designer** and a **Sound Designer**. These roles will be Nottingham based, to help prep the show for StuFF and tidying up technical aspects before Edinburgh, where the Technical Manager will take over.

Applications will open on Friday 7th May. If you are interested you should submit a **300-word application** by email, detailing why you are suitable for the role and why you want to take it on. Please consult the relevant committee member with any questions you have about the roles.
