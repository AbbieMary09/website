# Deadline for Proposals: {% include date.html date="ef-proposals-deadline" %}

We will be taking **two shows** up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year. We are performing in [Thespace venue: Perth Theatre.](https://www.thespaceuk.com/venue-specifications/thespace-on-north-bridge-perth/ "TheSpace venue: Perth Theatre")

> The festival is currently planning to go ahead as usual and thus this is our approach too.

With the ever changing nature of government restrictions and COVID-19 itself, we cannot guarantee that things will go ahead as planned. **By proposing you are accepting this risk.** We guarantee that you will not be negatively impacted in any financial capacity. It is unclear which restrictions we may need to follow during a real life performance. **Currently the most likely option is an outside performance.** The venue director will advise us on the safest way to perform and we will need to make the necessary adjustments. We ask for **flexibility and adaptability** in all proposing teams. We want the chosen shows to have the best chance at going ahead regardless of changing restrictions.

If you have any questions please get in touch with {% include committee.html role="external" format="inline" %}
