# Digital Season Spring 2021

With the start of a new university year comes the start of a new exciting term of theatre here at the NNT.

**You can look how to get involved in the upcoming digital season on our [audition page](/audition).**

This year is a fantastic opportunity for our membership to get creative with their shows and we hope that our many talented writers feel inspired to produce some really unique pieces of online theatre.

If you have any questions, please contact us via our [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/{{ site.facebook }}), or contact the relevant member of [committee](/about/#committee "Committee").

As always we thank all of our membership both new and old for supporting us during this time and we hope to see your wonderful faces soon.
