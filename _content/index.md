	<h1><i class="fa fa-fw fa-info-circle"></i>&nbsp;Covid-19 Announcement</h1>
	<p>Our devotion to the health and well being of our members takes priority. We take certain decisions with this at the forefront of our minds, and therefore have made the undesirable yet necessary decision to hereby close The Nottingham New Theatre indefinitely based on Government advice, and accept that we need to show responsibility in these unprecedented times.</p>
	<p>We wish our membership well and express our extreme gratitude for everyone and their understanding in these pressing times, and we will ensure to keep you updated with any further developments in the future.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, please contact us via our <a href="https://facebook.com/{{ site.facebook }}" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Facebook page</a> or email <a href="mailto:president@newtheatre.org.uk" class="alert-link">president@newtheatre.org.uk</a>. We hope to see you soon.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>As a note to all members, our annual hustings to elect the incoming committee will be going ahead in a fully digital format. More information can be found within the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/NNTmembers2019/" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Members' Facebook Group</a> in due course.</p>
