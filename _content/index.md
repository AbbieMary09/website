# Welcome!

Welcome to the Nottingham New Theatre! We are the only entirely student-run theatre in England. Producing over thirty shows a year, they range from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' to contemporaries plays, as well as a host of original student written pieces.

We are really excited to be reopening our doors for in-person theatre and welcoming in a whole new batch of exciting theatre makers.
