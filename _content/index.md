<h1><i class="fa fa-fw fa-info-circle"></i> Covid-19 Announcement</h1>
<p>Our devotion to the health and well being of our members takes priority. We take certain decisions with this at the forefront of our minds, and therefore have made the undesirable yet necessary decision to hereby close The Nottingham New Theatre until further notice, based on Government advice, and accept that we need to show responsibility in these unprecedented times.</p>
<p>We wish our membership well and express our extreme gratitude for everyone and their understanding, and we will ensure to keep you updated with any further developments in the future.</p>  
<p>However, we will not let this stop us from making theatre. We are launching a ‘Quarantine Season’ of virtual shows over the summer months. For further information about the season please consult the [‘Quarantine Season’ webpage](https://newtheatre.org.uk/quarantine "Quarantinelink").</p>  
<p>If you have any questions, please contact us via our <a href="https://facebook.com/{{ site.facebook }}" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Facebook page</a> or email <a href="mailto:president@newtheatre.org.uk" class="alert-link">president@newtheatre.org.uk</a>. Members are still encouraged to keep in touch and connect with each other through our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/NNTmembers2019/" target="_blank" class="alert-link">Members' Facebook Group</a>. We hope to see you soon.</p>
