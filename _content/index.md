# Welcome!

Welcome to the Nottingham New Theatre! We are the only entirely student-run theatre in England. Producing over thirty shows a year, they range from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' to contemporaries plays, as well as a host of original student written pieces.

We are really excited to be reopening our doors for in-person theatre and welcoming in a whole new batch of exciting theatre makers.

**In other news...**

DARKFIELD are currently running their show EULOGY at Lakeside Arts, and as part of this, are offering 10 of our members the chance to have a backstage peek into the workings of an immersive show that utilises binaural sound and special effects to take audience members on a journey through a dystopian hotel. It will be running at 11:00 this Sunday (3rd October) for an hour and a half and will be a great opportunity for those of you who are interested in looking at the backstage tech roles of shows, in particular the creative use of sound that they explore throughout this show. If you are interested, please head over to our Facebook group where you will be able to sign up on the form.
