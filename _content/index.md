# Welcome!

Welcome to the Nottingham New Theatre! We are the only entirely student run theatre in England. Producing over thirty shows a year, ranging from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' to contemporaries plays, as well as a host of original student written pieces.

We are really excited to be reopening our doors for in-person theatre and welcoming in a whole new batch of exciting theatre makers. Click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abpUGZepgRZKwcLlMa31-is_4L27Nwt8/view?usp=drivesdk) to see our reopening plans, or scan the QR code below:
