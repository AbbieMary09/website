### The Nottingham New Theatre's summer arts festival, on {% include date.html date="stuff" %}

<hr>

The Nottingham New Theatre’s summer arts festival – StuFF – is in its fifth year, and StuFF 2019 is running on {% include date.html date="stuff" %}. StuFF is an annual platform for student and professional theatre makers alike to showcase their work. We’re excited to have our biggest schedule to date on offer, with 18 shows across the two days ranging from stand-up, to film screenings; from short plays, to magic shows.

Each show at StuFF is an hour long, and is £3, with Day and Festival passes available at £15 and £25 per person, and with shows running from 11am-late on both days, there's something for everyone. The theatre bar will be open throughout the festival serving drinks and snacks, as well as additional food vendors around the venue.

The festival is taking place at the Nottingham New Theatre, Cherry Tree Hill, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD
