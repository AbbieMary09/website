# StuFF 

The Nottingham New Theatre’s Student Fringe Festival – StuFF – is in its fifth year, and StuFF 2019 is running on {% include date.html date="stuff" %}. StuFF is an annual platform for student and professional theatre makers alike to showcase their work. We’re excited to have our biggest schedule to date on offer, with 18 shows across the two days ranging from stand-up, to film screenings; from short plays, to magic shows.

The festival is taking place at the Nottingham New Theatre, Cherry Tree Hill, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD

For more information, please contact {% include committee.html role="fringe" alias="stuff" format="inline" %}.

## Bring your art to StuFF 

We’re looking for theatrical and performance art of any shape or size to join the StuFF lineup for 2019. Whether it’s a theatre play, spoken word poetry, a musical performance, or pretty much anything else, we’d love to see it!

For 2019, we have two theatre venues at The Nottingham New Theatre, the NNT Auditorium and NNT Studio. Most traditional performances go in here. We also have two foyer spaces, and can explore the surrounding area on University Park so if you’re looking for something a little more unusual, please get in touch and email {% include committee.html role="fringe" alias="stuff" format="inline" %}.

The best place to find out everything you need to know as a performing company about StuFF is to check out the Info Pack. If you’d like to perform at StuFF (and we’d love you to), fill in our Application Form, and we’ll be in touch.
