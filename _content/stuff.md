#### The Nottingham New Theatre's summer arts festival, on the {% include date.html date="stuff" %}

<hr>

The Nottingham New Theatre’s summer arts festival – StuFF – is celebrating its fifth year, with StuFF 2019 running on the {% include date.html date="stuff" %}. StuFF is an annual platform for student and professional theatre makers alike to showcase their work. We’re excited to have our biggest schedule to date on offer, with 18 shows across the two days ranging from stand-up to sketch comedy; from dramas to drag acts.

Each show at StuFF is an hour long, at £3 a ticket, with Day and Festival passes available at £15 and £25 a person. With shows running from 11am-late on both days, there's something for everyone. The theatre bar will be open throughout the festival serving drinks and snacks, as well as additional food vendors around the venue.

The festival is taking place at the Nottingham New Theatre, Cherry Tree Hill, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD.

For more information, please contact {% include committee.html role="fringe" alias="stuff" format="inline" %}.

### Festival and Day Passes

Please note that the purchase of a festival or day pass does not guarantee entry to any given show. Passes can only be purchased in-person at the New Theatre Box Office from 10:30am each day, and individuals will be given a wristband, as well as their name being taken.

We recommend that you reserve tickets to every show that you wish to see. Passes will then grant you a free ticket to any given show. Ticket reservations can be collected from half an hour before the advertised start time, and will be released 5 minutes before the start time.
