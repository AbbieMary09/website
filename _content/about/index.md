Based on University Park, Nottingham we are the only student run theatre in England. 2013 has already proved to be a ground-breaking year for us. The renovation of our building is now complete, meaning we have a beautiful new foyer, greatly expanded storage space, and two entirely new rehearsal rooms which will be adapted into fully equipped studio spaces by September 2013.

The last year has also cemented our reputation of producing work of an outstanding quality, with an incredible three productions selected to be showcased at the prestigious National Student Drama Festival. We received a fantastic seven awards for our efforts, including three Judges’ Awards for Acting (Company), Acting in a Supporting Role, Design, the Buzz Goodbody Student Director's Award and two Spotlight Acting Commendations.

## History

The New Theatre itself was converted from the Engineering block in 1969. Originally, the auditorium was levelled but raked seating and a proscenium arch stage were in place by 1972. The very first refurbishment of the auditorium occurred only one year after this, in the summer of 1973, when students installed a new lining of timber slats, a cloakroom area at the rear and locations for fire extinguishers. In 06/07 the black swirly logo was dropped for yellow/orange squares. In 07/08 they became orange/purple and in 09/10 they were neatened up in a brand overhaul, and in 10/11 a ‘banner’ system was introduced to ensure that every poster was clearly associated to the New Theatre.

## Finding The Theatre

We're easily accessible both by car and public transport. If you're driving you should enter University Park via the south entrance, and park in the Trent Building car park. From the car park walk up the steps at the back and a short way up the hill you'll find us on the left. The visitors’ car park operates free parking during our shows.

The 34 bus takes you directly onto campus from the city centre. Alight at the Portland Hill stop and walk up the hill. You'll find us down the second road on the left.
