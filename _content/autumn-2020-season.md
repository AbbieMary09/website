### The Nottingham New Theatre will be showcasing an Online and In-House season this Autumn

There will be two distinct seasons this Autumn, one running entirely online (similar to the quarantine season) and one running In-House at the Theatre. More details of how each season will work and how to get involved in proposing shows for either season are below.

#### The shows will be announced here and on our social media in the coming weeks, so keep your eye out for those.

## Resources

### In-House

The Nottingham New Theatre is happy to announce that we intend to put a show on stage this semester!

Following the rule of six, we are looking to create a couple of shows that can be done within social distancing guidelines, to then be filmed and uploaded to the NNT YouTube channel in the style of _National Theatre Live_.

This process will be challenging yet worthwhile, to attempt to bring back the spirit of theatre to our stage. It also allows us to expand on opportunities offered during the Quarantine Season, such as editing and video designing.

We are extremely excited to bring back theatre to where it belongs; the stage.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to email productions@newtheatre.org.uk

### Online Season

One of the Nottingham New Theatre's seasons that we will be running is a continuation of the very successful Summer Quarantine Season.

This is the online creation of virtual theatre which will be posted on the NNT YouTube channel and shared across our platforms for all to watch. We do this with the ambition to have theatre being made all through the term regardless of possible future further restrictions, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic.

This process has the potential to be incredibly rewarding, not only for the actors involved, but also for aspiring writers, the imaginative video designers and editors, and the inquisitive members who want to learn new skills.

If you have any questions at all please feel free to email Jack Titley, Fringe Season Coordinator ‘[fringe@newtheatre.org.uk](mailto:fringe@newtheatre.org.uk)’

The shows will be announced here and on our social media in the coming weeks, so keep your eye out for those.

The following pack details how the ‘Quarantine Season’ will function as well as how to go about proposing a show to feature in the season.

If you are proposing a show you must complete the proposals form. Please contact one of the coordinators if you are considering proposing.

More information will follow regarding how to get involved in other aspects of the season once the shows have been confirmed.
